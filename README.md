# old-directx-engine

An old "engine" meant to help me with creating DirectX based apps/games

This code is from around 2003-2004 when DX9.0c was the latest.

Uses C# and .NET.

Tried to deal with:
- managing terrain surfaces based on heightmaps
- controlling inputs from various sources uniformly
- camera and walkaround strategies
- various utilities

The demo (executable) is a a simple surface walker with surfaces based on height maps.
